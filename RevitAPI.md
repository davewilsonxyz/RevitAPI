#### Research Revit Addins. Try and look at how they are built. Cowi tools. 

Look at good tools that have been built. 

DiRoots
RTV tools
Others?

#### Addin ideas 
Parameter checker. Identify missing parameters in the file and add them? Might be complicated with the type etc

MDC tool but in a addin. Need to have all of the parameters finalised but could maybe do this as a text file.
